  "description": "Explore your support structures—mentors, peers, education, and boundaries—that uphold your ministry journey.",
  "reflection": "Building and maintaining healthy relationships and boundaries is essential for sustaining a holistic ministry. Relationships with family, friends, colleagues, and the community provide support, encouragement, and accountability. Establishing clear boundaries helps protect our time, energy, and emotional well-being, allowing us to serve others effectively without experiencing burnout. Reflect on the relationships and networks in your life. Are they nurturing and supportive? Are your boundaries clear and respected? Consider how you can cultivate and strengthen these connections to enhance your ministry.",
  "verse": "Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up. - Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 (NIV)",
  "prayer": "Heavenly Father, we thank You for the relationships and networks You have placed in our lives. Help us to cultivate and maintain healthy connections that support and sustain our ministry. Grant us wisdom in establishing clear boundaries that protect our well-being and enable us to serve others effectively. May our relationships be filled with love, encouragement, and accountability, reflecting Your grace and truth. Strengthen our bonds with those around us and guide us in building a community that honors You. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.",
